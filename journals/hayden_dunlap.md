Today we created our repository and began working on our first migration file. Our base tables are now created and we have a solid idea of which APIs we will use for our application.

Today we attampted to set up authentication in the back end using JWTdown but we have much to do tomorrow before this will be complete.

---03/30/2023---
Today we finished routers and queries for packing lists.

---04/03/2023---
Today we worked on creating routers and queries for our individual day lists.

--04/03/2023---
We are still working on our routers and queries, we should be able to start on our weather and location apis soon.

---04/05/2023---
Today we finished our routers and queries and we are working on getting our location and weather data and using it. We decided to save all of the location data in a table instead of hitting the api every time, so we made queries for that as well.

We started front end authentication but made very little progress today.

---04/07/2023---
Today we completed front end authentication.

---04/17/2023---
Began working on getting redux set up and getting our data into the pages where we need it, but made very little progress.

---04/18/2023---
We are still working on getting our data into the react components where it is needed. Still working out the kinks with redux.

---04/19/2023---
Today we got stuck messing with our redux api file. A typo with a providesTags had us stuck for hours and we made little progress.

---04/20/2023---
Still working on getting our data on the front end. We are having to refactor some of our code on the backend to make it play nice together.

---04/24/2023---
Today we split up into two groups. Kyle and I worked on getting the data for the packlist and datelist pages and worked on getting the features for these pages working.

---04/25/2023---
Today we each took a page and began working on our styling. I am responsible for the packlist page, and so I am working on that.

---04/26/2023---
Today I spent most of the day getting the weather information to display on the packlist page. It was more difficult than I anticipated but I was able to get it working. I took most of the inline styling I had and put it into variables to be used inline to clean things up a bit.
