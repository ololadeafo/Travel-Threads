Monday March 27th - Now that we had our wireframe and API endpoints we were able to actually start coding! We are choosing to code as a group so we are able to solve bugs more efficiently so we all watched and lended our advice while Nina was at the wheel. We set up our docker compose and our requirements.txt file and were able to create our migrations! There were some kinks but we were able to work through them and everything works well.
Tuesday March 28th - We attempted authentication, ran into quite a few issues and didn't really get anywhere. It's been a really tough day.
